# Covid19 Images Classification
# About Dataset
X-ray samples of COVID-19 were retrieved from different sources for the unavailability of a large specific dataset. Firstly, a total 1401 samples of COVID-19 were collected using GitHub repository [1] , [2] , the Radiopaedia [3] , Italian Society of Radiology (SIRM) [4] , Figshare data repository websites [5] , [6] . Then, 912 augmented images were also collected from Mendeley instead of using data augmentation techniques explicitly [7] . Finally, 2313 samples of normal and pneumonia cases were obtained from Kaggle [8] , [9] .
